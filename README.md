# VCR Tape Directory

A VCR Library program written in Applesoft BASIC in 1987

## Getting Started

It consists of 4 pieces. The main program, a launcher program, a graphical font and a utility library to generate a GUI-like interface.

### Features

* Create new tape libraries
* Add, Remove, and Edit Tape contents
* Create custom labels to assign to entries
* Print reports
* More?

The GUI interface library, WINDOW SHOW, was written by Stephen Lew and published in Nibble Magazine, Vol 7 No. 7, July 1986. Copyright 1986 Microsparc Inc. The binary file is freely available online at nibblemagazine.com in the disk image section.  Consider ordering the compete collection of Nibble Magazine and read a piece of computer history!

The font used is not the one supplied by the Nibble Magazine article. That can be obtained from the disk image mentioned above. After over 30 years, I have forgotten where it came from. Since it's a semi-standard font binary used on Apple ]['s to display graphical fonts, it may have come from the Apple DOS Toolkit or some other font disk. Other font sets of a compatibile size could be used instead. Experiment!

### History
One of several Applesoft programs I wrote between 1985-1989 that utilized this GUI library. I am uploading here for posterity. The Window Show binary I originally typed in was disassembled, converted to a text file on a modern Mac and modified for Merlin compatibility to closely match the original source listing. This new source file was compiled with Merlin32, a cross assembler written by Antoine Vignau and Olivier Zardini of Brutal Deluxe Software (www.brutaldeluxe.fr) and matches the original binary.

### To Do
* Fix some bugs
* Figure out any limitations and modify
* Verify all print reports work

### Installing

Two Applesoft and two binary files need to be transfered to a Apple ][ compatible disk image and saved. There are several ways to this depending on your platform and tools. Using a Mac and Virtual ][, I copy & paste the Applesoft programs to the computer and save them manually. For the binaries I mount a folder as a DOS diskette and set the filetype to Binary, strip prefix. With this folder mounted as Drive 2, I use a copy utility to move them to my destination disk image. There are other ways.

a .DSK image is also available in the image folder
